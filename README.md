## Features

</br>

### Game Objectives (Mandatory part):

- **2D View**
- **Objective:** The player must collect all items on the map and escape via the shortest path.
- **Player Movement:** The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) and never through walls.
- **Movement Counter in shell** 

### Bonus Features:

- **Random Floor Pattern:** Ground textures are randomized, and external walls differ from the labyrinth walls inside the map.
- **Character and Monster Animation:** Both the player and monsters are animated during movement.
- **Monsters:** Monsters are programmed to pursue the player at all costs. If they encounter a wall blocking their path, they will attempt to find an alternative route to reach the player.
- **Health Management:** The player has three lives before dying.
- **Turn-Based Mechanics:** The player has as many moves per turn as remaining lives + 1, while monsters always have two moves.
- **User Interface (UI):** Displays move counter, item counter, lives remaining, and a turn banner indicating if it‚Äôs the player‚Äôs or monsters' turn.

### Key Hooks

| Key     | Description       |
|:--------|:-------------------
| ESC        | Quit the game  |
| W or ‚¨ÜÔ∏è     | Move up        |
| S or ‚¨áÔ∏è     | Move down      |
| A or ‚¨ÖÔ∏è     | Move left      |
| D or ‚û°Ô∏è     | Move right     |

</br>

### Map Structure `(.ber formar)`

Each map in .ber format should adhere to specific structural rules:
   - The map is rectangular and closed by walls on all edges.
   - Contains one 'P' (Start) and one 'E' (Exit).
   - Items ('C') must be collectible, with a path allowing the player to reach all items before accessing the Exit.
   - Only the characters shown in the table below are allowed:

| Character | Description   |
|:--------|:-----------------
| P       | Start point     |
| E       | Exit point      |
| C       | Item            |
| 0       | Void / Flat     |
| 1       | Wall            |
| M       | Monsters        |

  -  Contains header files

- **src/**
   - [`main.c`](./src/main.c) - Entry point of the program
   - [`so_long.c`](./src/so_long.c) - Manages core game functions
      - [`game/`](./src/game/) - Contains gameplay logic, including player movement, item collection tracking,monster behavior, and win/loss conditions.
      - [`map/`](./src/map/) - Handles map-related functions, such as loading and validating .ber map files and checking paths for game elements like the exit and items.
      - [`mlx/`](./src/mlx/) - Manages the interface with the MiniLibX library, including creating windows, rendering textures, and updating the display.
      - [`utils/`](./src/utils/) - Utility functions

- **textures/**
   - Contains the game's textures, stored in .xpm format

- **map/**
   - Directory for .ber maps, including both valid and invalid configurations for testing.

- **librairies**
   -  [`MinilibX`](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx) The graphical library provided by 42
   -  [`Libft`](https://github.com/MathysCogne/MyLibft_GNL_Printf) A custom implementation of the Libft library with essential functions



</br>

## Compilation and usage
</br>

**Dependencies**

- Libft: This project depends on my Libft. Automatically downloaded and installed when you run the make command.

- MiniLibX: The MiniLibX library will be automatically downloaded and installed when you run the make command. Ensure you have the necessary [`prerequisites`](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html) on your machine.
</br>

**1.** To compile, simply run the `make` command:

*This Makefile was generated by my generator available here: [`MakeMyFile`](https://github.com/MathysCogne/Make_My_File-42)*
```bash
make
```
``make bonus``
``make clean``
``make fclean``
``make re``

</br>

**2.** After compiling, run the game with the following command:

```bash
./so_long [path/to/map.ber]
```
